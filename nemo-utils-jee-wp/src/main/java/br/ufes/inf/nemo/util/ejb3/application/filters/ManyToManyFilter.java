/**
 * Many-to-many filters can be used when the thing we need to filter is an entity associated with the filtered entities
 * by a many-to-many association. In this case, subFieldNames must contain a comma-separated list of fields of the
 * associated entity, while joinedCriteria should contain an optional list of criteria to be applied to parameters of
 * the associated entity (much like criteria holds for the filtered entity. In the persistence layer, the database will
 * perform an inner join between the filtered entity and the associated entity and apply the criteria to both.
 * 
 * As an example, imagine a scenario where products can participate in offers (promotions). Offers can contain many
 * products and products can participate in many offers, given that offers have a starting and ending date. If an offer
 * has a name (e.g. "Christmas 2009 sale!"), a many-to-many filter can filter the products that participate in an offer
 * that have "christmas" in their name. Furthermore, with joinedCriteria you can filter out offers that haven't yet
 * started or have already ended, for example.
